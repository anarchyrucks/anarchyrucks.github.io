      <description>A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure, created by Burton Howard Bloom in 1970. It is used to test whether an element is a member of a set with no false negatives.
In Bloom Filter, we hash an element with k-hashing algorithms, generate indices from these hashes and then set the value at these indices to 1 in the filter-list. To check if an element is in the set, we run the same k-hashing algorithms on that element and check if all the values at the indices produced by the hashes are 1.</description>

      <description>In this first article titled &amp;ldquo;Hello, World&amp;rdquo; (a bit Cliché), I want to write about why the blog started and the plans that I have for the future of this blog.
I follow a lot of personal blogs like Coding Horror, Martin Fowler, Paul Graham Essays and many more that I come across through Hacker News. I am always amazed at how impactful these “One Person” blogs are and the amount of discussion each piece of article brings.</description>
